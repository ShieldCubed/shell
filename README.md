Stoxswap introduces a novel decentralized protocol for cross-chain atomic swaps
tailored for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), ROSE
(Oasis Network), Dash (DASH), and Horizen (ZEN), alongside major assets including
Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). By
leveraging pattern-free post-quantum cryptographic primitives, Stoxswap ensures
quantum-resistant security while mitigating transaction traceability through adaptive
obfuscation techniques. The system operates via browser-based and desktop terminal
bridges, enabling seamless, intermediary-free exchanges without compromising user
privacy or network scalability. This whitepaper details the protocol's architecture,
cryptographic foundations, implementation roadmap, and security considerations,
positioning Stoxswap as a foundational layer for privacy-centric DeFi in a postquantum era.
